# Insurance Price Prediction Model

**Final Project – Web Application for Insurance Pricing**

This project explores machine learning approaches to predict insurance pricing based on customer and policy attributes. As part of our group initiative, we developed a web application that integrates predictive modeling with an interactive user interface.

To challenge our understanding and improve model performance, we sourced a significantly larger and more complex dataset—nearly 10× the size of the original. This enriched dataset included a wider variety of variables, which introduced strong multicollinearity but also offered deeper predictive potential.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- 📦 **Data Expansion**: Integrated a large-scale dataset with diverse features, enabling more robust modeling.
- 🧠 **Model Comparison**: Evaluated multiple ML algorithms (Linear Regression- Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, etc.) across both datasets.
- 🌲 **Random Forest Performance**: Found that Random Forest consistently outperformed other models as sample size increased.
- 🧪 **Feature Engineering**: Applied domain-informed transformations and forward selection to optimize input features.
- 🧰 **Web Integration**: Deployed the final model within a user-friendly web interface for real-time insurance pricing predictions.
